This code was created as an assessment for a company. The description was:

Convert a text number to a real number
-----------------------
Write a class that converts a written number to its equivalent 'real' number. An example number:

Honderdvierentwintigduizend driehonderdvijftig

Result: 124.350

Support up to hundredthousands is enough. When there is enough time, we would like to see the following extra's:
* Unit test for class
* Support for millions and billions
* Multilanguage

This was originally written in PHP and now I have ported it to Kotlin
